# Obstacle Dodge

My very first game project using the Unity game engine, guided by the Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D Course in Udemy.
It is a very simple obstacles game, where the player starts at a position and needs to get to the finish position,
dodging as much obstacles as he can. Every time the player touches an obstacle, the obstacle turns red and the player loses a point.
